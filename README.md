## Hi, I'm Carlos Araya

I started my career as a frontend developer and spent the next 8 years in product management, leading cross-functional teams and delivering user-centered solutions. This background in both building and strategizing products has given me a unique perspective on bridging technical implementation with business impact.

Over the past year, I've returned to my technical roots, focusing on AI solutions and backend development. My product management experience has proven invaluable in approaching technical problems from a user-first perspective while maintaining a systems-thinking mindset.

- Currently building an AI-powered news recommender at [bepayper.com]([bepayper.com](https://www.bepayper.com/)), a news service provider.
- Learned backend development in Go to deepen my full-stack and systems knowledge.
- 🛠️ Developing a vacation rental management platform using vanilla HTML/JS with Tailwind CSS, Go web server backend, and PostgreSQL database, deployed via CI/CD on AWS
- 🎯 Passionate about leveraging AI to solve real user problems, from initial concept through technical implementation
