## Hi, I'm Carlos Araya

I started my career as a **frontend developer** and spent the next eight years in **product management**, driven by a passion for building meaningful products and collaborating with cross-functional teams to shape long-term product strategy.

Over the past year, I’ve **returned to my technical roots, focusing on AI solutions and backend development**. My product experience has been invaluable in approaching technical challenges with a user-first mindset while maintaining a systems-thinking approach.

- **Currently building an AI-powered news recommender** at [bepayper.com](https://www.bepayper.com/), a news service provider.
- **Learning backend development in Go** to deepen my full-stack and systems knowledge.
- **Developing a vacation rental management platform** as a side-project, using vanilla HTML/JS with Tailwind CSS, a Go web server backend, and PostgreSQL, with CI/CD on AWS.
- **Passionate about leveraging AI** to solve real user problems—from initial concept through technical implementation.
