## Hi, I'm Carlos Araya

I started my career as a frontend developer and spent the next 8 years in product management. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve focused on exploring and prototyping AI solutionsâ€”from pitching ideas to delivering real proof-of-concepts.

Driven by curiosity and a hands-on mindset (plus a fair share of sweat and tears), I've transitioned my career back to building, this time AI solutions.
